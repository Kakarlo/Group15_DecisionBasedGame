            You arrive at the south of the forest, where a curse lays. Before you is a wet and damp swamp, with the effects of the curse changing the color of the water to an eerie purple.<br>
            <br>
            In front of you is an enclosure, where a beast-man priest with a lion\'s head stands in the middle. His eyes are pale, and lifeless. He notices your presence, and braces himself.
